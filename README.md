# Team Name: CardioRAG
Task: Enhancing Cardiac Care with Temporal Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Model to Achieve Task: Vanilla Baseline RAG + Temporal RAG
Reasoning: In cardiology, specific conditions can evolve over time and vanilla RAG models aren't the best at capturing those evolutions so by implementing a Temporal RAG that takes into account sequential events, we can track those evolving conditions and act accordingly. 

Code: Currently In Juptyer Notebook for Vanilla RAG but plan to do metrics and build the Temporal RAG Architecture.
